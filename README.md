# Ansible Projects Showcase

Welcome to my collection of **Ansible** projects! This repository contains a variety of Ansible playbooks, roles, and automation examples that aim to simplify infrastructure management, application deployment, and configuration. These projects are designed to automate real-world tasks with Ansible, and I'm excited to share them as open-source for the community to learn from, contribute to, and build upon.

## Projects Overview

In this repository, you'll find the following projects:

### 1. **Automated Application Deployment**
   - Ansible playbooks to deploy applications with minimal setup, ensuring a consistent and repeatable process.
   - Designed for both web and backend applications, including complex multi-tier setups.

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Ansible**
   - Use Ansible to define infrastructure components such as servers, networks, and storage.
   - Examples include provisioning infrastructure on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) or on-premise solutions.

### 3. **Configuration Management and System Hardening**
   - Playbooks to automate system configurations and security hardening for various Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).
   - Focus on securing servers and ensuring they adhere to industry best practices.

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Use Ansible to automate the setup of CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and others.
   - Automate the deployment of code to production with seamless integrations for continuous integration.

## Key Features
- **Modular playbooks**: Each project is broken down into reusable playbooks and roles that can be customized for your environment.
- **Cloud and on-premise support**: Playbooks are designed to be flexible, allowing you to manage both cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP) and traditional on-premise servers.
- **Open-source contributions**: This repository is open for contributions! Feel free to submit issues, create pull requests, or suggest improvements.
- **Documentation**: Each project includes detailed setup instructions and code examples to help you get started quickly.

## How to Use

1. **Clone this repository**:

     ```bash
     sudo apt install ansible    # For Ubuntu/Debian systems
     # OR
     sudo yum install ansible    # For CentOS/RHEL systems
     ```

3. **Running a Playbook**:
   - To execute any playbook, simply run the following:

     ```bash
     ansible-playbook <playbook_name>.yml
     ```

   - Make sure to check the specific instructions for each project or playbook in the respective directories for required variables and environment configurations.
